# CoreSubmission

Hey Brian and Team!

Thanks for pulling down my project, and for giving me the opportunity to take your coding challenge. 

Getting this to run shouldn't be an issue. 

I've pull it down and run it on two machines, the only issue was needing to update my SDK to 3.1.300

I've also run it with 'dotnet run' in VS Code from the directory containing .csproj, and launched it from Visual Studio 2019 at the solution root.

Thanks again, and I hope to speak again soon.
